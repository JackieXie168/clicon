/*! Differences between two databases in terms of add, delete change per database key.

 * index can be different in the two databases. In most CLICON usages, the first db is 
 * typically running and the second is candidate, but the function is more general.
 *
 * The operation is one of:
 *  FIRST  - the key exists only in database 1, ie delete (removed in 2nd)
 *  SECOND - the key exists only in database 2, ie add (added in 2nd)
 *  BOTH   - the key exists in both databases, ie changed
