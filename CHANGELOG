R2.3.0 
=================
Two new documents have been written and resides in the docs document:
clicon-datamodel.pdf and clicon_db2txt.pdf. Together with an updated
clicon_tutorial.pdf should give a good overview of the clicon system.

The clicon data model has been better defined, extended and generates
validation and CLI code more complete. Please see the datamodel
description.

make install and make install-include replaces make runtime/sdk. This
is more inline with what you "would expect". You install files under
/usr/local, but can change this with --prefix=<somethingelse>. Files
are installed under lib, bin, etc, sbin, and share. See "Installation
appendix" in clicon tutorial for more info.

A default hello application residing in share is installed in
/usr/local/share/clicon by default. This is a runnable "hello"
application. 

The order in which applications find the installation has been
changed. An applications looks for APPDIR first (instead of
CONFIGFILE). APPDIR is assumed to be in /usr/local/share/clicon,
unless (in order of priority):
   (1) The application has the -a option set
   (2) The environment-variable CLICON_APPDIR is set
   (3) The --with-appdir configure option; 
The config-file is assumed to be $APPDIR/clicon-conf, unless overridden
by the -f option.  This behaviour differs from the previous, when
configuration file was looked for in a separate directory and APPDIR
was defined within the configuration-file.
